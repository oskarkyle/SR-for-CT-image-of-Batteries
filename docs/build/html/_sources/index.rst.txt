Welcome to SR for CT images of Batteries with Deep Learning's documentation!
============================================================================
This project is about **Super Resolution for CT image of batteries with Deep Learning**. 
The goal is to improve the resolution of the CT image of batteries. 
The model from project is based on UNet from paper *U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation* <https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597>. 
The model is trained on the dataset from paper *Multimodal Nanoscale Tomographic Imaging for Battery Electrodes* <https://doi.org/10.1002/aenm.201904119>.
